#NBA Player Stats 
Zach Hoeing, 
Curtis Clemmons,

This project was made to give the user fast and easy access to their favorite player's live or previous stats,
while also having the ability to compare their stats side-by-side with another player. The stats consist of 
the nine fantasy relevant statistics.

To construct this project we used Gradle, Java 13, JavaFX, IntelliJ IDEA, an API from data.nba.net 
under NBA Properties Inc. ("NBAP") Prospective NBA License. This project was made for a school project, and we are not making a profit from this product and we are not selling this product either.
